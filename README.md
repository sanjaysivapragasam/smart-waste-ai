# Smart Vision System for Real-Time Waste Classification ♻️

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **final-year engineering capstone project** that develops an **AI-powered waste management system** using computer vision and machine learning to automatically identify and categorize waste items.  
The goal is to improve sorting accuracy and reduce environmental impact by enabling **real-time inference on edge devices**, with results displayed through a responsive **web application dashboard**.

The solution is designed as a cost-effective prototype suitable for:
- Smart cities  
- Public institutions  
- Home automation systems  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to classify waste (plastic, paper, metal, etc.).  
- Deploy the trained model on an **edge device** with real-time inference.  
- Design a **web application** to visualize results.  
- Establish communication between the edge device and the web app using APIs or WebSockets.  
- Optimize for **accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency**.
